# Introduction
Shape is a form of an object or its outer boundary or outline. Everything we see around us has a shape, from a coin to giant buildings. Shapes are of different types, they can be broadly classified as open or closed. Closed shapes can further be classified as two-dimensional or three dimensional. Two dimensional shapes are constrained to lie on plane whereas the three dimensional shapes are solids.

# Explaination
When it comes to shapes, two dimensional or three dimensional, we have certain parameters which helps in understanding the shapes better. They provide an insight on the size of the shape's boundary, expanse of the shape, etc.

# Two dimensional shapes
Two dimensional closed figures can further be classified as regular polygons, irregular polygons and curves.
Regular polygons: The 'n' sides of this polygon are of same size and the angles formed between any two sides are equal.
Irregular polygons: The 'n' sides of these polygons may not be of same size. Some commonly used irregular * polygons are rectangle, parallellogram, etc.
Curves: They are made up of single curve which starts and ends at the same point.
Paramters describing two dimensional shapes are perimter (gives the length of boundary) and area (gives the expanse of the shape).

# Three dimensional shapes
Three dimensional solids that we come across in our day to day life are: sphere, cone, cube, etc.
Paramters describing three dimensional shapes are lateral surface area (provides the curved sureface area), total surface area (gives the sum of curved surface area and the base area), volume (gives the capacity of the shape).

# Defining our system
The system allows the user to choose out of the 3 categories: regular polygons, irregular polygons and curves, three dimensional shapes.
Inside each choices, the user is made to choose the actual shape for which he wants compute the paramters.
After choosing the shape, the user is asked to input certain parameters required for computation, and the result is printed.
