# Genesis_cpp_miniproject_shapes_calculator

# Shapes Calculator
This application is used for calculating certain parameters that are assosciated with a shape, which provides a better understanding about the shape. 

For 2-D shapes:
* Regular polygons: perimeter, area, interior and exterior angles are calculated.
* Irregular polygons and curves: perimeter and area are calculated.

For 3-D shapes:
* Three dimensional shapes: volume, lateral surface area and total surface area are calculated.
* Other three dimensional shapes: volume and surface area are calculated.
